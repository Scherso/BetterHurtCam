  2. Run:
  - Unix in Terminal:
     
  Note: If you plan to only build once add the `—no-daemon` flag to the build. 
  ```bash
  cd ForgeTemplate ; chmod 755 ./gradlew && ./gradlew --refresh-dependencies build
  ```
  - Windows in Powershell:

  ### IDE Setup

  1. Open the project from `File > Open...` Select ForgeTemplate from it’s given file location. 
  2. Let the IDE collect dependencies and index the code. (this may take a couple seconds)
  3. Go to `File > Project Structure... > SDKs` and make sure an SDK for Java 17 is installed and selected, if not download it [here][jdk]

  ### Build

  Test if the environment is set up correctly setup by clicking the refresh button in IntelliJ’s Gradle tab, if it has indexed properly with no errors do the following:
  1. Go to `ForgeTemplate > Tasks > loom > genSources` in the Gradle tab and run `genSources`
  2. To build the mod as a jar run `ForgeTemplate > Tasks > build > build`. Gradle will create a new directory called `build`. 
  3. Once this process is done, the .jar file will be located in `build/libs` You can see this in your file tree.
