# Hurt Animation Remover

A mod which allows the user to adjust Minecraft's hurt animation with a number value.

## This mod's usage on Hypixel

BetterHurtCam automatically adjusts the hurt cam value to 6 (if lower than this) which is identical to Lunar's reduced hurt animation feature when on Hypixel (except on Skyblock). This is to not make the mod blacklisted on the server.
